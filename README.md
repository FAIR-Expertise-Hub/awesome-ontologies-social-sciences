# Awesome Ontologies for the Social Sciences [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
*What*: A curated list of ontologies, controlled vocabularies and semantic artifacts for the social sciences

*What is an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list?*

This list collects useful ontologies, vocabularies, terminologies, and taxonomies for modelling, publishing and enriching (meta)datasets from the social sciences. If you wish to contribute, send a PR or get in touch with [Angelica Maineri](mailto:angelica@odissei-data.nl). 

If you want to learn more about semantic artefacts (in general and for the social sciences) we recommend the following resources:

## Contents

## Ontologies look up services
_If you canâ€™t find what you look for in this list, you might want to try a look up service or database_
- [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/vocabularies): The Basic Register of Thesauri, Ontologies & Classifications (BARTOC) is a database of vocabularies and terminology registries from any subject area, in any language, any publication format, and any form of accessibility.
- [CESSDA vocabularies](https://vocabularies.cessda.eu/): discovery, browsing and downloading platform for controlled vocabularies maintained by the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA). It also includes DDI vocabularies.
- [EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index): Repository for biomedical ontologies; developed and maintained by the Samples, Phenotypes and Ontologies Team (SPOT) at EMBL-EBI.
- [EuroVoc](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies): Collection of multilingual controlled vocabularies maintained and developed by EU institutions. 
- [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/): Curated collection of vocabularies used to describe Linked Open Data.  
- [Ontobee](https://ontobee.org/): a linked data server for ontology terms. Ontobee supports ontology visualization, query, and development. 

## General
_General-purposes terminologies and lexical databases_
- [Babelnet](https://babelnet.org/): multilingual encyclopaedic dictionary, including over 22 million entries semantically connected to each other.  
- [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/): Lexical database of the English language

## FAIR data stewardship
_Terminologies and thesauri linked to FAIR implementation_
- [FIP ontology](https://peta-pico.github.io/FAIR-nanopubs/fip/index-en.html): ontology of the FAIR Implementation Profile framework.
- [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/): ontology to describe the provenance of information in Web documents, data, and resources.
- [Simple Knowledge Organization System  - SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/): standards to represent semantic artefacts (e.g. thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading systems)
- [SSHOC Multilingual Data stewardship terminology](https://vocabs.sshopencloud.eu/vocabularies/sshocterm/en/index/A) : Multilingual list of terms related to data stewardship; terms are linked to other terminologies (e.g. Terms4FAIRskills).
- [Terms4FAIRskills](https://github.com/terms4fairskills/FAIRterminology): Terminology of skills for supporting FAIRification efforts. 

## Methods and statistics
- [DDI Mode of Collection](https://ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-CV/ModeOfCollection_3.0.html): Controlled vocabulary maintained by DDI listing modes of data collection.

## Topics and Subjects
_Controlled lists of subject headers_
- [ICPSR Thesaurus subjects index](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/thesaurus/index): Controlled vocabulary system maintained by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) and including controlled lists of social science subject terms, geographic and geopolitical entities,  organisations, and names.

- [STW Thesaurus for Economics](https://zbw.eu/stw/version/latest/about.en.html): Thesaurus including 6,000 standardized subject headings and about 20,000 additional entry terms to facilitate indexing and searching of economic literature. It is maintained by ZBW - Leibniz Information Centre for EconomicsActivities maintained by the Conference of European Statisticians of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, UNECE.
