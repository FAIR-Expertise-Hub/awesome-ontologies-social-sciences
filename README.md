# Awesome Ontologies for the Social Sciences
*What*: A curated list of ontologies, controlled vocabularies and semantic artifacts for the social sciences

*What is an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list?*

This list collects useful ontologies, vocabularies, terminologies, and taxonomies for modelling, publishing and enriching (meta)datasets from the social sciences. If you wish to contribute, send a PR or get in touch with [Angelica Maineri](mailto:angelica@odissei-data.nl). 

If you want to learn more about semantic artefacts (in general and for the social sciences) we recommend the following resources:
