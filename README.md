# Awesome Ontologies for the Social Sciences [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
*What*: A curated list of ontologies, controlled vocabularies and semantic artefacts for the social sciences

*What is an [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list?*

This list collects useful ontologies, vocabularies, terminologies, and taxonomies for modelling, publishing and enriching (meta)datasets from the social sciences. If you wish to contribute, please check the [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md) or get in touch with [Angelica Maineri](mailto:angelica@odissei-data.nl). 

Please note that, unless otherwise stated, the resources are in English. When available, the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) assigned by [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/) is added. 

If you want to learn more about semantic artefacts (in general and for the social sciences) we recommend the following resources:
