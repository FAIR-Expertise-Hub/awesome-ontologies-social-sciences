# How to contribute to the Awesome Ontologies for the Social Sciences
Do you want to propose a new resource to be added to the list, or an edit/update, or did you find a mistake (e.g. a broken link) and want to report it? Please read this document! But first, thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project and sharing your knowledge!

# Option 1: Pull requests (PRs)
To submit a changed version of the list ([README.md](./README.md)) with your own additions, you can work on the GitHub web interface. We recommend the following:
- Fork this repository in your own workspace (please note: you can also do it by clicking on the little edit/pen icon on the top right side of the Markdown viewer on the GitHub web interface)
- Commit/push your changes in that fork; please do not forget to add a short description;
- Submit a pull request to the master branch of this repository.

## Formatting rules
When editing the [list](./README.md), please:
- Please follow the logic of the headings and the general Markdown formatting rules; you can always preview the results;
- If you add a new category, please add a pointer to it in the table of contents; 
- To list a new resource, first add a link to it, then a colon (:), and then a short but informative description of the ontology; please have a look at existing entries for examples;
- Resources should be listed alphabetically within categories;
- If available, also add a DOI pointing to the resource on FAIRsharing.
For any doubt, you can also open an issue and/or send an email. 

# Option 2: Create an issue
Click on Issues and create a New Issue. A template for proposing new resources is available. Otherwise, create a blank issue, add a short and informative title, explain your suggestions in the Comments field, and submit the issue.


# Option 3: Send an email
If you don't have a GitHub account, or if for any reason you prefer to send an email, please feel free to do so and contact [Angelica Maineri](mailto:angelica@odissei-data.nl).

# List yourself as contributor
When you are done, please edit the [contributors list](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) and add your name, affiliation and ORCID at your own discretion.
